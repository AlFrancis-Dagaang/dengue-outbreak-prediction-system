# Dengue Outbreak Prediction System

## Overview
The **Dengue Outbreak Prediction System** is a Python-based project that integrates **machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches to predict dengue outbreaks. The system uses:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for mosquito image analysis.
- **Random Forest** model for dengue outbreak prediction using meteorological data, dengue cases, and mosquito counts.

This repository contains all the code and scripts needed to train, evaluate, and test the models.

> **Note:** Image datasets are **not included** in this repository due to GitHub storage limitations. The complete mosquito image dataset can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lrzYXMQ0Auf-Ha4U_Y-G4jPiFNTimKl7?usp=sharing).

## Notes

- Ensure all CSV datasets are present before running the scripts.  
- Line ending warnings (`LF will be replaced by CRLF`) on Windows are normal and do not affect the code.  
- Images are excluded to reduce repo size; download them from the link above if you want to train the CNN.
